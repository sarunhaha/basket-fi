# Testing Strategy Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Basket.fi monorepo, implementing a pragmatic testing pyramid that ensures code quality, reliability, and maintainability across all applications and packages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unit Testing Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for core business logic, so that I can confidently refactor and extend functionality without breaking existing features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backend services are developed THEN Jest SHALL be used as the testing framework with 70%+ coverage on core business logic
2. WHEN frontend packages are developed THEN Vitest SHALL be used as the testing framework with 70%+ coverage on utility functions and hooks
3. WHEN unit tests are written THEN they SHALL test individual functions, classes, and components in isolation
4. WHEN core business logic is modified THEN existing unit tests SHALL continue to pass or be updated accordingly
5. WHEN new features are added THEN corresponding unit tests SHALL be written before or during implementation

### Requirement 2: Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests for API endpoints and database operations, so that I can ensure different components work correctly together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are developed THEN Supertest SHALL be used to test HTTP request/response cycles
2. WHEN database operations are tested THEN test containers SHALL be used to provide isolated database instances
3. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL test the interaction between services, databases, and external APIs
4. WHEN integration tests are executed THEN they SHALL run against realistic data scenarios
5. WHEN database schema changes THEN integration tests SHALL validate data integrity and migration correctness

### Requirement 3: End-to-End Testing

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want automated end-to-end tests for critical user journeys, so that I can ensure the complete application works as expected from a user's perspective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN web application features are developed THEN Playwright SHALL be used for E2E testing
2. WHEN mobile application features are developed THEN Detox MAY be used for E2E testing (optional)
3. WHEN E2E tests are written THEN they SHALL cover critical user flows including authentication, basket creation, and rebalancing
4. WHEN E2E tests run THEN they SHALL execute in headless mode for CI/CD pipelines
5. WHEN E2E tests fail THEN they SHALL provide screenshots and detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 4: Static Analysis and Type Safety

**User Story:** As a developer, I want static analysis tools to catch errors before runtime, so that I can maintain code quality and prevent common bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN ESLint SHALL enforce coding standards and catch potential issues
2. WHEN TypeScript is used THEN strict mode SHALL be enabled to ensure maximum type safety
3. WHEN data validation is needed THEN Zod schemas SHALL provide runtime validation
4. WHEN code is committed THEN static analysis tools SHALL run automatically and block commits with errors
5. WHEN type definitions change THEN TypeScript SHALL catch breaking changes across the monorepo

### Requirement 5: Continuous Integration Pipeline

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated testing in CI/CD pipelines, so that code quality is maintained and deployments are reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to GitHub THEN GitHub Actions SHALL run a test matrix across Node.js LTS versions and operating systems
2. WHEN CI pipeline runs THEN pnpm dependencies SHALL be cached to improve build performance
3. WHEN tests execute in CI THEN unit, integration, and E2E tests SHALL run in parallel where possible
4. WHEN tests complete THEN coverage reports and test artifacts SHALL be generated and stored
5. WHEN tests fail THEN the CI pipeline SHALL fail and prevent merging to main branch

### Requirement 6: Test Coverage and Quality Metrics

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want visibility into test coverage and quality metrics, so that I can ensure adequate testing across the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests run THEN coverage SHALL be measured and reported with minimum thresholds enforced
2. WHEN coverage reports are generated THEN they SHALL be available as CI artifacts and in pull request comments
3. WHEN code coverage drops below thresholds THEN the build SHALL fail
4. WHEN test performance degrades THEN alerts SHALL be generated for investigation
5. WHEN quality gates are not met THEN deployment SHALL be blocked until issues are resolved

### Requirement 7: Test Environment Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent and isolated test environments, so that tests are reliable and don't interfere with each other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL use containerized databases for isolation
2. WHEN E2E tests execute THEN they SHALL use dedicated test environments with clean state
3. WHEN tests require external services THEN mocks or test doubles SHALL be used appropriately
4. WHEN parallel tests run THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other's data or state
5. WHEN test environments are torn down THEN all resources SHALL be properly cleaned up

### Requirement 8: Performance and Load Testing

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want automated performance tests, so that I can ensure the application meets performance requirements under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are developed THEN performance benchmarks SHALL be established
2. WHEN load testing is performed THEN realistic user scenarios SHALL be simulated
3. WHEN performance regressions are detected THEN alerts SHALL be generated
4. WHEN database queries are optimized THEN performance improvements SHALL be measured
5. WHEN performance tests run THEN results SHALL be tracked over time for trend analysis
