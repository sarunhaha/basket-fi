# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables Basket.fi users to explore, analyze, and interact with liquidity pools on Monad Testnet. The integration provides comprehensive liquidity pool data, DEX protocol support, and foundational infrastructure for future DeFi features like automated rebalancing and cross-DEX arbitrage opportunities.

The feature serves as a critical building block for Basket.fi's DeFi portfolio management capabilities, allowing users to understand liquidity availability across different protocols and make informed decisions about their token basket compositions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a portfolio manager, I want to view all available liquidity pools on Monad Testnet, so that I can understand the liquidity landscape for my token baskets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the liquidity pools section THEN the system SHALL display a list of all active liquidity pools from supported DEX protocols
2. WHEN pools are loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states with progress indicators
3. IF no pools are found THEN the system SHALL display a helpful message explaining possible reasons
4. WHEN pool data is displayed THEN each pool SHALL show token pair, reserves, protocol name, and basic metrics
5. WHEN I refresh the page THEN the system SHALL fetch the latest pool data from the blockchain

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DeFi trader, I want to search for specific token pairs across different DEX protocols, so that I can find the best liquidity options for my trades.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter token addresses in the search fields THEN the system SHALL find all pools containing those tokens
2. WHEN search results are returned THEN pools SHALL be sorted by liquidity depth (highest first)
3. IF invalid token addresses are entered THEN the system SHALL show validation errors with helpful guidance
4. WHEN I clear the search THEN the system SHALL return to showing all available pools
5. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL search across all supported DEX protocols simultaneously

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a liquidity provider, I want to see detailed information about each pool including reserves and fee structures, so that I can evaluate potential yield opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a pool THEN the system SHALL display current reserves for both tokens with proper decimal formatting
2. WHEN pool information is shown THEN the system SHALL include the fee percentage and protocol information
3. WHEN I click on a pool THEN the system SHALL show additional details like total supply and last update time
4. IF pool data is stale THEN the system SHALL indicate the age of the data and offer to refresh
5. WHEN viewing pool details THEN the system SHALL show links to the DEX protocol's interface

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a portfolio analyst, I want to see aggregated statistics about the liquidity ecosystem, so that I can understand overall market conditions on Monad Testnet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the pools overview THEN the system SHALL display total value locked (TVL) across all pools
2. WHEN statistics are shown THEN the system SHALL include the number of active pools and supported protocols
3. WHEN I view top pools THEN the system SHALL show the 10 highest liquidity pools with their key metrics
4. IF TVL calculation is not available THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this limitation and show alternative metrics
5. WHEN viewing statistics THEN the system SHALL update data automatically at regular intervals

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the system, I want reliable blockchain connectivity and error handling, so that the application remains stable even when network conditions are poor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN blockchain calls fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 3 times
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
3. IF a DEX protocol is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue working with other available protocols
4. WHEN RPC endpoints are slow THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators and allow user cancellation
5. WHEN connection is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically resume normal operation without user intervention

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle multiple DEX protocols efficiently, so that we can easily add new protocols as they launch on Monad Testnet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new DEX protocols are added to configuration THEN the system SHALL automatically include them in pool discovery
2. WHEN a protocol is marked as inactive THEN the system SHALL exclude it from queries without affecting other protocols
3. IF protocol contract addresses change THEN the system SHALL allow easy configuration updates
4. WHEN protocol queries fail THEN the system SHALL log appropriate warnings for debugging
5. WHEN multiple protocols are queried THEN the system SHALL handle them concurrently for optimal performance
