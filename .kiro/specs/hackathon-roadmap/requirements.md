# Hackathon Roadmap Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a 4-week hackathon-friendly development roadmap for Basket.fi, focusing on delivering a complete MVP with core functionality, polish, and demo-ready features within the hackathon timeframe.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Repository Bootstrap and Foundation

**User Story:** As a development team, I want a fully bootstrapped monorepo with core infrastructure, so that we can start building features immediately without setup overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project starts THEN the monorepo SHALL be configured with Turborepo, pnpm workspaces, and TypeScript
2. WHEN developers join THEN they SHALL be able to run `pnpm dev` and have all services running locally
3. WHEN code is committed THEN ESLint, Prettier, and Husky hooks SHALL enforce code quality
4. WHEN the database is needed THEN PostgreSQL with Prisma SHALL be configured and seeded
5. WHEN authentication is required THEN Web3 wallet connection SHALL be implemented with RainbowKit

### Requirement 2: Core User Flows Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to complete the entire basket management workflow from wallet connection to rebalancing, so that I can manage my DeFi portfolio effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the app THEN I SHALL be able to connect my Web3 wallet securely
2. WHEN I'm authenticated THEN I SHALL be able to create a new basket with token allocations
3. WHEN I create a basket THEN I SHALL be able to simulate and backtest its performance
4. WHEN I'm satisfied with the basket THEN I SHALL optionally deploy it on-chain
5. WHEN market conditions change THEN I SHALL be able to rebalance my basket
6. WHEN I want to monitor THEN I SHALL be able to track performance and set up alerts

### Requirement 3: Polish and Testing Phase

**User Story:** As a user, I want a polished, bug-free experience with comprehensive testing, so that the application feels production-ready for the demo.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is used THEN the UI SHALL be polished with consistent design and smooth interactions
2. WHEN features are tested THEN end-to-end tests SHALL cover all critical user journeys
3. WHEN the app is deployed THEN it SHALL work on testnet with real blockchain interactions
4. WHEN bugs are found THEN they SHALL be fixed with proper error handling and user feedback
5. WHEN performance is measured THEN the app SHALL load quickly and respond smoothly

### Requirement 4: Demo Preparation and Metrics

**User Story:** As a hackathon team, I want comprehensive demo materials and metrics, so that we can effectively present our solution to judges and users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preparing for demo THEN usage metrics and analytics SHALL be implemented and tracked
2. WHEN documentation is needed THEN comprehensive docs SHALL be written for users and developers
3. WHEN presenting THEN a demo script SHALL be prepared with key talking points and user flows
4. WHEN pitching THEN a pitch deck SHALL highlight technical achievements and business value
5. WHEN judges evaluate THEN the app SHALL demonstrate clear value proposition and technical excellence

### Requirement 5: Story Point Estimation and Prioritization

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want accurate story point estimates and prioritized backlog, so that we can plan sprints effectively and deliver on time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks are estimated THEN story points SHALL follow Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
2. WHEN prioritizing THEN MoSCoW method SHALL be used (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)
3. WHEN planning sprints THEN team velocity SHALL be considered for realistic commitments
4. WHEN dependencies exist THEN they SHALL be clearly identified and managed
5. WHEN scope changes THEN impact on timeline and priorities SHALL be assessed

### Requirement 6: Risk Management and Contingency

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want identified risks and contingency plans, so that we can adapt quickly if challenges arise during the hackathon.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN technical risks are identified THEN mitigation strategies SHALL be documented
2. WHEN scope is too large THEN features SHALL be clearly marked as optional or stretch goals
3. WHEN blockers occur THEN alternative approaches SHALL be available
4. WHEN time is running short THEN features SHALL be de-scoped in priority order
5. WHEN demo day approaches THEN a minimum viable demo SHALL be guaranteed

### Requirement 7: Team Coordination and Communication

**User Story:** As a team member, I want clear communication channels and coordination processes, so that we can work efficiently together during the intense hackathon period.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN work begins THEN daily standups SHALL be scheduled for coordination
2. WHEN tasks are assigned THEN clear ownership and deadlines SHALL be established
3. WHEN blockers arise THEN they SHALL be communicated immediately to the team
4. WHEN code is ready THEN pull request reviews SHALL be completed within 4 hours
5. WHEN milestones are reached THEN progress SHALL be communicated to all stakeholders

### Requirement 8: Technical Architecture Decisions

**User Story:** As a technical lead, I want clear architectural decisions that balance speed with quality, so that we can build quickly without creating technical debt.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN choosing technologies THEN they SHALL prioritize developer velocity and team familiarity
2. WHEN building features THEN they SHALL use existing libraries and frameworks where possible
3. WHEN writing code THEN it SHALL be simple, readable, and maintainable
4. WHEN integrating services THEN they SHALL use well-documented APIs and SDKs
5. WHEN deploying THEN the process SHALL be automated and repeatable
